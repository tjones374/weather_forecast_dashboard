# weather_forecast_dashboard

Overview

This homework required building a weather dashboard application that the end user could enter their location and receive back the current weather conditions including city, date, icon image, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.

Challenges

My goal was to come to an understanding as to how to connect all of the pieces between html, css, javascript, and jQuery. Additionally, I am struggling to recall the functions, how they work together, the correct syntax, and when to use what. It is still extremely confusing to google and get snippets of code and explanation but nowhere can I find to put the entire picture together.

Resources Used

I reviewed and tried to "re-do" the class activities associated with javascript and jQuery to put some of the missing pieces together. I also used freeCodecamp, W3Schools, MDN, Stack Overflow, jQuery docs, and Bootstrap 4 docs as well as open weather API docs. early in the week, I met with my tutor and reveiwed the assignment with her to get questions answered.

Lessons Learned

While I still am not able to connect all of the pieces, I have gained greater insight into using Bootstrap and CSS with my html. While there is growth, I am feeling very, very far behind.

Next Steps

I will reveiw this homework and my code with my tutor on Tuesday and have a goal of understanding and resubmitting a finished product in the next week.
